This folder contain feature matrices used in training and testing for the thermal expansion dataset.

Currently, it contains two folders with zip files:

1. Regression -> Feature Matrices of Regression tasks for 10,041 MOFs
2. Classification -> Feature Matrices for Classification tasks for 33,131 MOFs

Within each zip folder, there will be different `csv` files for `geometric`, `racs` and `topological` descriptors for each MOF. The name of each MOF is indexed in the last column of the `csv` files.
