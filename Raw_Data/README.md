## This folder contains the raw data `csv` data files from the curated dataset of thermal expansion properties of MOFs.

1. `Thermal_Expansion_Classes.csv` contains the classification of thermal expansion classes for the MOFs (PTE, NTE, ATE) and their Pearson-R square values.
2. `Thermal_Expansion_Cofficients.csv` contains the thermal expansion coefficients for 10,041 MOFs and their topologies and metal types.
3. `LAMMPS_ERROR.csv` contains the list of MOFs that failed during LAMMPS simulation.
